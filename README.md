Flask Empty
===========

This is my (Charles LeDoux) personal fork of the Flask-Empty project. It
has been customized to fit my preferences.

Flask-Empty is a simple **flask boilerplate** for fast prototyping. Just
use cookiecutter and create a new project in no time.

```shell
# if cookiecutter is not installed
sudo pip install cookiecutter

# using cookiecutter // linux/Mac
cookiecutter https://github.com/cledoux/flask-empty

# answer the prompt and you're done!
```

Setup
=====

You're advised to use virtualenvwrapper from here on. Install it like this:

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

Create a virtual environment for you project and install the adequate requirements.

```
mkvirtualenv my_project
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt  # dev environment if local
pip install -r requirements/prod.txt  # prod environment if server
```

You're advised to change the requirements files according to your needs.

We are using requirements files instead of a setup.py because this is the
common practice of the Flask community. Flask apps aren't generally installed,
thus a setup.py file is not usually created.

Important files to be aware of
==============================

### project/config.py

**extensions.py** all extension instances that need initialization should be available
here in order for _BaseApp_ to see and initialize them for you.

**config.py** is a pre-set configuration classes for you to meddle with. They're are all self explanatory
and commented.

**main.py** the _BaseApp_ class inherits from the _Flask_ class. Override it if 
you need to setup
extensions, an index view, context processors, etc. It already has sensitive defaults for most
 features. (see **baseapp.py** to better understand _BaseApp_)

**database.py** setup your database library there. There is some commented code for sqlalchemy support out of the box.

**PROJECT_NAME.ini** is the configuration file used with
[uwsgi](https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi). Use it like this:

```
uwsgi --ini your_project.ini
```

**manage.py** adds few very useful commandline commands (...) to help your development productivity. Check
available commands by running **python manage.py**.

## Heroku

BaseApp comes with a pre-configured _procfile_ and _heroku()_ wrapper for 
_app_factory_. No setup required.

## Observations

Note that the Flask-Script option "-d (disable debug)" does not work as expected with Flask-Empty. If you want
to start a non-debug internal server instance, use the **config.Config** configuration or write your own. Example:

```python
# loads config.Config configuration, which has DEBUG=False
# -r is the Flask-Script option for internal server no-reload
python manage.py -r -c Config
```

If [environment config named APP_CONFIG is set](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/config/#configuring-from-files),
it will be used, overwriting any other set configuration.

Other topics
============

## Templates

There are some error templates bundled with flask-empty by default. All empty right now. Just fill them up for
your project.

## Macros

You can use the jinja2 macros available in **templates/macros** to easily integrate your jinja2 templates with
flask extensions like wtforms and commons tasks like showing flash messages. Available macros, **formhelpers**
and **flashing** are very useful.

## Blueprints

Add your blueprints using **src/config.Config.BLUEPRINTS** as documented in the file itself. A blueprint can be add
using the path to the Blueprint or a tuple. Make sure your blueprint has a views.py and
it has a **app** Blueprint instance and you're ready to go. If unsure, check out **flask-empty/blueprint/**
for an empty blueprint example. You can also copy **flask-empty/blueprint/** to create blueprints.

With flask-empty, blueprints can live in the project root or in a special folder called **apps** in the project root.


# Supported Extensions

## Flask-SQLAlchemy

While creating your project, Flask-Empty will ask you if you wish to enable SQL support. Confirm if you do so
and Flask-SQLAlchemy will be available and configured through **database.py**.

_ps: currently, db-create will only create your models if they are imported somewhere in your application.
By **somewhere**, try the *same module where your Blueprint instance is defined*.

## Flask-Mongoengine

As mongodb is really cool, supporting it is a must. Just say yes at the prompt when asked
and Flask-Mongoengine will be setup for you.

## Flask-WTF

Flask-WTF is the "the facto" extension for handling forms with Flask. It is simply great, and Flask-Empty
supports it! Just say "yes" during project creation and Flask-WTF support will be on.

## Flask-Admin

Just create an admin.py file in your blueprint, define your admin models inside and change
**LOAD_MODULES_EXTENSIONS** to also pre-load admin, like this:

```
LOAD_MODULES_EXTENSIONS = ['views', 'models', 'admin']
```

## Other Extensions



Examples
========
If my explanation above is as crappy as I think it is, you're gonna want/need to take a look at **examples/**. They
are a very nice starting point to learn how to configure your project. Wort-case-scenario, just copy it, rename it,
configure it and be happy!

FAQ
===
**Is flask-empty _boilerplate_ compatible with flask 0.x? Cuz' that's what my app uses.**

Right now, flask-empty is a very simple project where many good practices and code examples were glued together.
Until recently I was focused in keeping backward compatibility with flask 0.8. Well, **that goal is no more**.
 Flask-empty will be compatible with the latest version of Flask and, by chance, with previous versions.
 Things will be easier this way.

**So, which is the oldest version where flask-empty works?**

In my last test, version 0.9, but no guarantees here.

**I think flask-empty should have _this_ and _that_ configured by default. Will you add support?**

My current goals are:

* Make flask-empty real easy to start a project with
* Keep things simple and robust

If your suggestion is simple, **VERY** useful and has little overhead, I'll probably consider adding it to the
project. If you make the code and send a pull request, then I'll consider it real hard. Now, if your suggestion is
 rejected or advised in a different approach, don't get sad (you're awesome ;).

**I just made a cool example with flask-empty and want to add it to examples.**

Pull request it for evaluation ;)
Just keep in mind that good examples are short (not really...) and focused in it's showcase.
